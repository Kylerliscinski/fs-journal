# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? - Learning about API's was good. It was cool to see how you can pull from online databases.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? - I didn't know about API's before this and I didn't realize that is how you communicated with other databases.
- What are you struggling with? - Remembering every term is hard. I still have to look back at the class notes to remember a certain word or how to use it.
- What would you count as a victory? - Getting through this week so far lol.
