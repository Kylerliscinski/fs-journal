# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Synchronus code goes line by line, never stopping, always reading the code. With asynchronus code, you can use "await" to paus enad wait for something to happen before running that specific line of code.

02. What is an event listener?

  > It is a function that waits for an "event" to hear from. It can be something like an "onclick" for example.

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > REpresentational State Transfer. It allows two computer systems to communicate with one another.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > A callback is used to "come back to something" inside your code. If you are trying to load an image or something wiht a lot of data, you can have it in a callback function so that it loads while your page is up and runnning so your page doesnt rely on waiting for that one item. 

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > It will produce a value in the futrue when called upon. You can add a catch to capture any errors from your promises. 

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > XML, JSON, and HTML.

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application programming interface. It is used to request and gather data from recources across the web. 

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > You have to add async in front of the function the awit command is in. Then you can put the await in front of the line of code you want to wait to run. 

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > It gorups things together in one component. This way you can prevent unintended use of the content inside. 

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200 ok.

11. What is a 400 error?

  > It stands for a bad request. It means that the server you are trying to access can't process your request.
