# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Learning about Vue has been fun and makes things more simple in my mind.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? The simplicities that Vue adds.
- What are you struggling with? Being sick lol. I hate not being able to be all there.
- What would you count as a victory? Getting through the labs so far and feeling like I am understanding it.
