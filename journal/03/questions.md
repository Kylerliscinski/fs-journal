# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Abstraction is the idea of taking something complex and wrapping it up in simple terms so that Someone can easily use the code you've written. Encapsulation is the idea of grouping things together as much as possible when it makes sense so that you keep things neat and tidy. Inheritance is the concept of creating parent classes so that when you create child classes, they already have an "outline" to go by. Polymorphism is the ability to use conditions that can work in multipule places.

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > "export" is used to export multipule values. "export default" is used to export a specific value that is well difined.

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > Encapsulation is the idea of grouping things together as much as possible when it makes sense so that you keep things neat and tidy.

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > A proxy allows us to control the behavior of a target object. It can be used to manipulate the DOM.

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > when creating a class, you are creating a blueprint. An instance of a class is more or less an object that uses the class blueprint. 

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > A comuted property lets you declare functions.

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > In short, it is helpful for organization of files. When using the MVC pattern as our projects get bigger ang bigger we can keep thins organized nicely in folders and files. 

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > The controller is responsible for the user inputs. It will supply buttons, or anything that the user would use.

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > The service takes in the inputs from the controller and does something with them. This will be where you create functions that your controller draws from.

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > The model is the blueprint for the websites data. This is where you will create stuff like what an object looks like, eg. "what does a snack have" - name, price, img, etc.
