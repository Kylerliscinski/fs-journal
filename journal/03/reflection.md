# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?  I really enjoyed learning the MVC pattern. I really enjoy structure and this made organization so easy.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? I don't think anything was a shokc neccesarily, but there was definetly a lot of info this week.
- What are you struggling with? Again I just struggle with remembering when to imput specfic things or terms when you have "banana" words.
- What would you count as a victory? So far all of my labs have gone fairly smooth. I have really enjoyed this week and all of the new things we have learned.
