01. What is Inheritance?

> It is the relationship between a parent and a child object. These should be reusable peiced of code. 

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> This allows us to provide an interface for creating objects in a overall class while allowing subclasses to be changed. This pattern allows for a lot of flexibility. 

06. What is test driven development?

> Allows you to write code according to test standards. Postman can be used for this. You add a test, ensure it failse, write the code, ensure the test passes, refactor, then repeat.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> It is a set of critera that the team must meet so the application is ready for the client.
