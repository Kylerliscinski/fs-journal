# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
   >  It is way to keep code in  order and keep track of what changes have been made. When working with other developers, it is a way to keep track of changes and edit from person to person.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > It stands for "Make Directory." It is used to create new folders.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > It allows you to access specific classes while styling with CSS.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity allows us to give certain elements we add "specific" tags. Example - .title

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > This feature "trumps" all others, so you are pretty much discarding and skipping over all of the other tags you may have created.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, Property, and Value. (h1, color, "rgba(etc.)")

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Functionality and simplicity are two large ones. If you are on a website looking for something specific and the website is to complex to find the button you want then it just creates a frustrating environment. 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > A wireframe is used as a kind of blueprint when designing a website or application, as the name implies. 

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes, for me personally, I work better once I have a template. I think that if you use a wireframe it can help ensure that you are not forgetting anything, you have the aspects of your website that want to be included. 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > flex allows you to fit your containers to how you want them on your webpage.  

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > You can use padding, margins and other like commands
