# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? > I was able to complete the "CoolWebsite" needing to much help
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? > As complicated as Web design is, I didn't think it was this simple. (that is a completely non-functional website lol)
- What are you struggling with? > I think the hardest thing for me is remembering all of the different commands at the correct time.
- What would you count as a victory? > So far, completing the "CoolWebsite"
